Use matlab to generate an HTML image gallery page, based on the template: http://www.derby-webdesign.co.uk/2012/09/minimal-free-responsive-website-template/
The matlab file has some initializations at the top of the script, including the path to the directory containing thumbnail images to display on the gallery page, as well as the directory of files to link to from the thumbnails. In the sample provided, both the thumbnails and what they link to, are the same images. However, the thumbnails can be made to link to other HTML pages (for instance so taht each thumbnail image leads to another image gallery). To do this, simply put HTML files in the directory imDir, and make sure that these files can see the required css style files. Then set extType2 = 'html', and the code will run the same way.
