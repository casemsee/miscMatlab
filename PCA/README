[evecs,mean,evals] = mypca(X):
% Compute PCA dimensionality reduction on data matrix X, where each column
% is a data point, and each row represents a variable. The transpose trick
% is used to reduce computation in case the number of data points is less
% than the number of variables. Returned are the eigenvectors ('evecs'), 
% eigenvalues ('evals'), and the 'mean' taken over all the datapoints, 
% used for mean-centering the data.

[evecs,mean,coeffs,evals] = mydimred(X,type,num):
% Compute PCA dimensionality reduction on data matrix X, where each column
% is a data point, and each row represents a variable. 
% If type == 1, return the top num eigenvectors ('evecs') and eigenvalues
% ('evals') computed, and project X onto this basis of eigenvectors.
% If type == 2, return the eigenvectors that account for the top num% of
% the total variance in the data, and project X onto this basis. Also
% return the 'mean' taken over all the datapoints, used for mean-centering 
% the data. 'coeffs' is the projection of X onto the eigenbasis.
