C = plotConfusion(trueLabels,estLabels,names,color,ordering)
% generate a rotatable 3-dimensional confusion matrix; the z entry of the
% (i,j) cell is the percent of labels i that were labelled j
% also return the computed confusion matrix C (as a 2D matrix); 

See sample image generated: confMatrix.eps

% input variables:
% trueLabels: an integer array of the ground truth labels
% estLabels: an integer array of the estimated labels
% names: (opt) a cell of label names; if this is emitted, the labels will
%        be assigned numerical names (in the plot, along the axes)
% color: (opt) a matlab colormap; default: 'hot'
% ordering: (opt) an array of integers that specifies the order in which to
% arrange the labels; default: confusion matrix is ordered in terms of
% decreasing diagonal entry (presumed to be maximal visibility)
