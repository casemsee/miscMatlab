When certain code needs to be synchronized with an audio or screen recording, this can be done through matlab and AppleScripts. AppleScripts interface with MAC applications, by passing all required parameters to the apps and getting them to run. One useful application of this is to have matlab start up a screen recording as some interaction is done with the user to record the screen session, and then (given some user feedback), to end the screen recording. I'm using this code skeleton to synchronize eyetracking with screen interaction.
