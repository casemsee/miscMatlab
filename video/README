vidToVecImages(indir,outdir,k,ext,togray)
% Takes as input a directory of videos (indir), a frame rate k, an
% output directory (outdir), a video extention (e.g. 'mpg','mov',etc.);
% vectorizes every k^th frame of each video (if togray = 0, then all 3 
% color channels are separately saved; otherwise, images are grayscaled
% before being vectorized). The vectorized images are then put into a data
% matrix allData which gets saved in a mat file with the same name as the 
% input video.
